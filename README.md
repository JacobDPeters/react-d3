# React for D3 Users
These resources are designed to teach D3 users how to scaffold their projects using React. To see the hosted versions of these projects, visit mfviz.com/react-d3. **Demos** are completed demonstrations of certain techniques, while **exercises** contain instructions for building a particular page (a `*_solution.js` file is also included). 

These resources were developed for a workshop at
<a href="http://www.openvisconf.com/" target="_blank">OpenvisConf 2018</a>. All code is available <a href="http://github.com/mkfreeman/react-d3" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. Built by <a href="http://mfviz.com" target="_blank">Michael Freeman</a>.

## Prerequisites
This workshop assumes that you are comfortable building visualizations with D3 and using underlying programming languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). **No prior React** knowledge is assumed or needed. The only technology you will need on your machine is the ability to run a local server. Any local server is fine, but in case you don't have one installed, here are a few suggestions:

## Getting Started
To use these materials, you should `fork` and `clone` this repository to your machine (if you don't have a GitHub account, you can simply download them to your machine). 

Then, I suggest you start running a local server in the _root_ of the repository to view an the avaiable set of exercises and their descriptions ( you can see this online [here](http://mfviz.com/react-d3)). Then, you can **explore** the code for any given repository `*-demo`, or work through the instructions in any exercise (repos with the suffix `-exercise`). 

## Feedback + Additional Resources
If you like these resources, share them far and wide! Feel free to submit a _pull request_ for any errors, or create an _issue_ for something you believe is incorrect.

For additional resources, see this [online course book](http://info343.github.io/) I co-authored on **Client Side Web Development**, or see what I'm up to [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mf_viz).
